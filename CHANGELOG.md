## 0.3.0
### Breaking changes
* Crate has new maintainer: Wojciech Polak :hand: :tada:
* Crate has new name, as `test-case-derive` had no meaning for `derive` part.
* Delimiter for test case description is `;` instead of `::`.

  Reason: `::` is valid part of expression and rustc treats const variable as path
### New features
* Proper error propagation :tada:
  When there is for example a typo in function body, rustc can now show location
  of it instead of `test_case` location.
* Internally for tests crate uses `cargo insta` for snapshot testing
* Attribute is now compatible all other attributes like `#[should_panic]`
